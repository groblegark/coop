/**
 * Offset-gated dedup for PTY replay streams.
 *
 * When a WebSocket client subscribes to `pty` events and requests `replay:get`,
 * there is a race window where broadcast PTY events cover the same byte range
 * as the replay response. Writing both to the terminal corrupts the display.
 *
 * `ReplayGate` tracks the highest committed byte offset and deduplicates
 * incoming Replay and Pty messages so each byte is written exactly once.
 *
 * The Rust mirror lives at `crates/cli/src/replay_gate.rs`.
 * Changes must be mirrored and both test suites must pass.
